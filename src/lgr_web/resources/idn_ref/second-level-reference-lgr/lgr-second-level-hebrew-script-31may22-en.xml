    <h1>Reference Label Generation Rules for the Hebrew Script</h1>
 
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This document specifies a reference set of Label Generation Rules (LGR) for the Hebrew script for the second level. 
    The starting point for the development of this LGR can be found in the related Root Zone LGR [RZ-LGR-Hebr]. 
    The format of this file follows [RFC 7940].</p>    

     <p>For details and additional background on the script, see “Proposal for Hebrew Script Root Zone LGR”, Version 1.2, February 2019 [Proposal-Hebrew].</p>

<p class="notice">This document is a Review Draft and not final. Any version numbers shown are those of a possible future release. However, the draft may undergo significant revisions before any publication, or may be withdrawn.</p>

<h2>Repertoire</h2>
    <p>The repertoire contains 27 code points for letters, 5 of which are variants (final forms) of 5 others. 
     The repertoire supports the Hebrew and Yiddish languages with restrictions appropriate for domain names. The repertoire is
      a subset of [Unicode 11.0]. For details, see Section 5, “Repertoire” in [Proposal-Hebrew]. 
    (The proposal cited has been adopted for the Hebrew script portion of the Root Zone LGR.)</p>
      
      <p>The Hebrew script is written from right to left. More details can be found in 
      Section 3, “Background About the Script and Languages Using it” in [Proposal-Hebrew].</p>
     
     <p>For the second level, the repertoire has been augmented with the ASCII digits, U+0030 to U+0039, and U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, 
      for a total of 38 repertoire elements.</p>

        <p>Code points outside the Hebrew script that are listed in this file are targets
        for out-of-script variants and are identified by a reflexive (identity)
        variant of type “out-of-repertoire-var”. They do not form part of the
        repertoire.</p>

      <p><b>Repertoire Listing:</b> Each code point or range is tagged with the script or scripts with which the code point is used,
      and one or more references documenting       sufficient justification for inclusion in the repertoire, see “References” below. 
      Comments provide additional information for some code points.</p>

     <h2>Variants</h2>
    <p>This reference LGR is designed for use in zones shared by more than one script.
     Where appropriate, cross-script variants have been defined to mutually exclude labels
     from different scripts that could otherwise be substituted by the users. Once a label
     has been delegated for one script, any of its variant labels consisting entirely of cross-script variants would be
     blocked. Any label containing at least one code point that is not a cross-script variant
     would be considered distinct. Because of that, even large numbers of defined cross-script
     variants generally do not lead to a high percentage of labels experiencing a collision.</p>

    <p>According to Section 6, “Variants”, in “[Proposal-Hebrew]”, this LGR defines five in-script variants, which are final forms of five in-script letters. </p>

     <p>Because a common use case would be for a zone to also support LDH labels, the reference LGR contains
     definitions for “blocked” variants for letters that look indistinguishable from ASCII letters (homoglyphs).
     None of these variants has any effect when using the LGR in a standalone fashion, but if the zone also
     supports LDH labels, any label that consists entirely of Hebrew letters that have ASCII counterparts
     could be “blocked” by a corresponding LDH variant label.</p> 

 <h3>Additional variants</h3>
    <p>When integrated to be used with another script LGR in the same zone, this LGR may inherit additional blocked cross-script variants by integration; they may not be listed here unless they result in
    in-script variants.  
    Always use an applicable merged, or Common LGR created by integration for determining cross-script collisions of labels.</p>
   
    <p><b>Variant Disposition:</b> All variants are of type “blocked”, making labels that 
    differ only by these variants mutually exclusive: whichever label containing either of 
    these variants is chosen earlier would be delegated, while any other equivalent labels should be blocked.</p>
    
   <p>This LGR does not define allocatable variants.</p>
  
   <p>The specification of variants in this reference LGR follows the guidelines in [RFC 8228].</p>
    
    <h2>Whole Label Evaluation (WLE) and Context Rules</h2>
    <h3>Common Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Hyphen Restrictions</b> &mdash; restrictions on the allowable placement of hyphens (no leading/ending hyphen
             and no hyphen in positions 3 and 4). These restrictions are described in Section 4.2.3.1 of RFC 5891 [150]. 
             They are implemented here as context rule on U+002D (-) HYPHEN-MINUS.</li>
          <li><b>Leading Combining Marks</b>   &mdash;  restrictions on the allowable placement of combining marks
             (no leading combining mark). This rule is described in Section 4.2.3.2 of RFC 5891 [150].</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Right-To-Left Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>leading-digit</b> &mdash; RFC 5893 [160] restrictions on the allowable placement of digits (no leading digit), see section 2.1; 
         implemented here as a context rule on each digit.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Default Actions</h3>
    <p>This LGR includes the default actions for LGRs as well as the action needed to
        invalidate labels with misplaced combining marks. They are marked with &#x235F;.
        For a description see [RFC 7940].</p>
        
    <h3>Hebrew-specific Rules</h3>
    <p>This LGR does not define rules specific to the Hebrew script.</p>

    <h2>Methodology and Contributors</h2>
    <p>This reference LGR for the Hebrew script for the second level has been developed by Michel Suignard and Asmus Freytag, based on the Root Zone LGR for the Hebrew 
    script and information contained or referenced therein, see [RZ-LGR-Hebr]. 
    Suitable extensions for the second level have been applied according to the [Guidelines] and with community input. 
    The original proposal for a Root Zone LGR for the Hebrew script, that this reference LGR is based on, was developed by the Hebrew Generation Panel. 
    For more information on methodology and contributors to the underlying Root Zone LGR, see Sections 4 and 8 in [Proposal-Hebrew], as well as [RZ-LGR-Overview].</p>
    
    <p>[IL-IDN] was consulted during the work on this LGR.</p>

    <h3>Changes from Version 1</h3> <p>Unicode Version has been updated.</p>
        <p>Blocked variants have been added for homoglyphs of ASCII letters. These have no effect unless the
        LGR is used together with LDH labels in the same zone.</p>
